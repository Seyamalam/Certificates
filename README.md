## How this section is automated

This section of the README is automatically updated using a GitHub Action. 

1. **The Action:** A GitHub Actions workflow is set up to run on a schedule (e.g., daily) or whenever changes are pushed to the repository.
2. **Scanning for Certificates:** The workflow uses a script to scan the `certificates/` directory for image files (e.g., PNGs).
3. **Extracting Information:** The script extracts the certificate name from the filename and formats it for display.
4. **Updating the README:** The script updates the section between the `<!-- CERTIFICATES START -->` and `<!-- CERTIFICATES END -->` comments in the `README.md` file. 
5. **Committing Changes:** If any changes were made to the `README.md` file, the workflow commits and pushes the changes to the repository.

This way, you can just add new certificate images to the `certificates/` folder, and the README will be automatically updated!
